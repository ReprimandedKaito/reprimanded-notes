It uses the Canvas API and depends on EaselJS and Three.js.

- Someone shared this website on r/danganronpa:
[Someone made a Danganronpa Non-Stop Debate generator | Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/danganronpa/comments/7k0l1p)

- Uses:
    * Canvas API
    * https://www.createjs.com/easeljs
    * https://threejs.org
    * https://github.com/fengyuanchen/cropperjs
    * jQuery


- What I dislike:
    * Not interactive. I expect the output to update as I change inputs.
    * The output is a static image.
    * The image's dimentions are 1000x650. This is not a standard aspect ratio. See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspect_ratio_(image)
