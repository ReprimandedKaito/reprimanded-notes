# The Art of Code - Dylan Beattie

YouTube: https://youtu.be/6avJHaC3C2U

**TLDR**: Showing off creative coding shit.

**Notes**:

- 2020-11-13 Wanis sent me this video.
He was probably looking up Flutter when this showed up in his recommendations, but I won't ask him about that.

- He showed FizzBuzz in the music programming language, Sonic Pi v3.1.

- Talked about snowflake systems, like those of banks and businesses, that are so fragile that if you change something, all hell may break loose.
IDEA: slow-server version names: Snowflake, Sloth, etc.

- OMFG, this talk is by the same dude who's made Rockstar. Loved that programming language's "concept."
About Rockstar, I have looked into creative coding and music programming, as you already know, but I've never done anything in this domain.
Music and audiovisual stuff are overwhelming for me, to be honest.

- The FizzBuzz song he performed at the end is wicked good!

FIN.
