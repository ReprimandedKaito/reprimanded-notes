> ## What is tunneling and how is it used?
> In the computing language, the meaning of tunneling is a protocol that moves data from one network to another, i.e. allows the movement of private communications over a public network using encapsulation. Tunneling repackages traffic data to a different form using encryption, thus hiding the data traffic that runs through it.
> 
> Tunneling has the following uses:
> 
>   - **Bypassing firewall**
>     Tunneling can be used to bypass a firewall, thus allowing a protocol that a firewall normally blocks to be wrapped inside a protocol that the firewall typically allows.
> 
>   - **Allowing foreign protocol**
>     Tunneling protocols allow foreign protocols that do not run over a particular network. For example, tunneling allows you to run IPv6 protocol over IPv4 network.
>
>   - **Creating virtual private networks**
>     Tunneling can help establish virtual links and create virtual private networks, thus allowing remote access to confidential resources. This ensures online privacy and anonymity even over the public network.
