# Selling projects

## Where?

**SideProjectors** is the website I mentioned to Sam where you can sell your hobby projects. Haven't tried it but found it to be very interesting.
I will use it someday and form a real opinion of it.
https://www.sideprojectors.com

**CodeCanyon** seems to be more popular and more serious if/since you have a well-implemented and well-designed project:
