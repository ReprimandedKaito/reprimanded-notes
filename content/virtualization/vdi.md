Ideas:
* Broker that spins up VMs. We could use Ngix Reverse Proxy to create and launch VMs (VirtualBox or maybe QEMU) with a random URL. Single image, maybe no need for COW. This is best for systems that do not need to persist data like online gaming (for my `Sloth::CloudGaming` project idea) since user data is saved on the game server anyways, and we don't bother (or we shouldn't?) save their login credentials anyways.
