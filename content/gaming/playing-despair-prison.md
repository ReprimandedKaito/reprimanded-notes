# Despair Prison: Updated Kaitofied Gameplay

#Android #Virtualization #VisualNovel #MachineTranslation

## Manual Doppelganger

- Install OBS and its Virtual Webcam plugin
  * OBS link
  * Webcam link

- Install some Android emulator that lets you install the Google Translate app and to expose your webcam to the emulated device.
  * I chose VirtualBox and Android-x86 (7.1 32-bit), but that may be a little overkill and complex for your use case.
  * [ ] BlueStacks should work fine.

- Open the game and capture it as virtual camera stream using OBS Window capture

- Open Google Translate app and choose camera translation.

- Put the two windows side by side and start playing (game) + reading (google translate android app)

- Done.


## Better methods

See r/visualnovels wiki page about this topic (texthooking and maybe other stuff). Machine translation is garbage. You can do better, if you out some effort (basically means learning Japanese and using a dictionary to translate words and expressions).

Or, if you're interested only in this specific game (Despair Prison or/and Wolf Game), a youtube channel called "Blue Horror Gaming" is uploading translated (dubbed?) gameplay of the game. The translation and voice acting are fine, IMO. I recommend checking it out.
That youtuber's series are still ongoing, but they are uploading frequently and are already in case 3+ in Zetsubou Prison.

Also, also, even if I could create a patch or translated version of the game (which I can by editing/translating the game files), I won't be sharing it because it goes against the game studio's terms/license. As an aside, Blue Horror Gaming is not releasing a translation of the game for this exact reason.
