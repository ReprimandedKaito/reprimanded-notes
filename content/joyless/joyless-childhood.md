# Joyless Childhood

Watched as a child.

- ÅŒban Star-Racers `[anime][Arabic dub]["on MBC3"]["I remember liking it"][MAL:anime:1212]`

- Silverwing `[cartoon][Arabic dub][imdb:tt0380955][opinion:liked]`

- Redwall `[cartoon][Arabic dub][opinion:liked][imdb:tt0200369]`
    * I remember thinking it was epic.
    * Rewatched Episode 11: Asmodeus (English dub).
    * [ ] Isn't "Smodios" (a word I vaguely remember repeating as a child) just a mispronounciation of Asmodeus?
    * "Zaba-ba" (shrew in English) is the mole-like animal.
    * I've been searching for this series for a long time. Apparently "an animated series about a mouse and a blind snake" wasn't a good enough hint for Google.

    * Based on a novel https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lost_World_(Doyle_novel)
