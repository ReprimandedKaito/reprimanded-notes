# Joyless Childhood

Watched as a child.

- Ghost Ship `[film][2002][Arabic sub]`
    * The movie about a haunted/ghost cruise ship where a woman in red kills people

    * I remember thinking it was epic.
    * 2022: Rewatched Episode 11: Asmodeus (English dub).
    * [ ] Isn't "Smodios" (a word I vaguely remember repeating as a child) just a mispronounciation of Asmodeus?
    * "Zaba-ba" (shrew in English) is the mole-like animal.
