# Joyless 2021

- Spiritpact (season 01) `[anime][Chinese][English sub][S:01][gay][aka:"Ling Qi", "Spirit Contract"][mal:anime:33605][opinion:meh]`
    * Subbed by E.P. of Bayi Subs.
    * The first episode reminds me of YYH's E01.
    * The unsynched subs were super annoying and irritating and made the anime unejoyable.
- Spiritpact (season 02) `[anime][Japanese][English sub][S:02][gay][mal:anime:36522][opinion:ok]`
    * on Crunchyroll.
    * I'm still confused though, what actually happened?

- The Emperor's Strategy `[anime][Chinese][gay][aka:"Diwang Gonglue"][mal:anime:37563]`
    * The story and settings are confusing to me.

- The Highschool Life of a Fudanshi `[anime][gay][mal:anime:33222][opinion:meh]`
    * Watched on Crunchyroll.

- Given: The Movie `[2020][anime][film][gay][imdb:tt11802992][mal:anime:40421][opinion:ok]`

- The Onion - Sex House `[series][parody][imdb:tt2316082][opinion:liked]`

- Danganronpa: Dead End v0.1.1.1 Demo `[game][visual novel][opinion:liked]`
    * [Danganronpa: Dead End by DjcatProductions | Itch.io](https://djcatproductions.itch.io/danganronpa-dead-end)

- Genius Party `[film][2007][opinion:liked]`
    * Masaaki Yuasa's _Happy Machine_ was wow.
- Genius Party Beyond `[film][2008][rewatch][opinion:liked]`

- Ginger's Tale `[2020][film][animated][opinion:ok]`
    * Not a great plot, but kinda warm. The Russian x ginger theme felt cool.

- Paris Is Burning `[1990][film][gay][documentary][imdb:tt0100332][opinion:liked]`
    * I watched it because RuPaul's Drag Race was said to be heavily inspired by it, and I agree with them.

- The Rising of the Shield Hero (season 1) `[anime][mal:anime:35790][English dub][opinion:liked]`
    * Watched English dub on Crunchyroll.
    * Not the story, but more like its presentation.
      The whole thing feels like a legit JRPG experience (similar tropes and mechanisms as traditional JRPGs like Chrono Trigger and Final Fantasy).
      By mechanisms, I meant "narrative devices" are similar to video game's.

- The Castle In The Sky `[1986][film][anime][opinion:ok]`

- Fist of the North Star `[anime][English sub][mal:anime:967][opinion:liked]`
  * It gets predictable very soon. Same formula virtually every episode:
    Go to an oppressed town, meet a nice person who does a nice guesture for Kenshiro, that person gets killed, Kenshiro stronger with sadness/rage and avenges them, liberating the town and inspiring the townpeople in the process.
- Fist of the North Star 2 `[anime][MAL:anime:1356]`
    * Interesting storytelling and doesn't follow the tired formula of the first season.
    * I liked the opening, and rarely ever skipped it.
    * I liked the first arc, "Imperial City"(?)
    * I liked Jakoh's laugh and scream (in Japanese). It's super annoying and I love it.
    * E110 "The Past Is Gone. The Dawn of the New Age!!" at 16:45 - Burning prisoners alone.
      'We won't just hand over the prisoners', says an Imperial soldier to North Star Army.
    * E119 "The Emperor's Cries Echoes Through the Imperial Capital. Falco, Where Have You Gone" at 13:45 - Using Bruse Lee sticks(?)

- Mob Psycho 100 `[anime][English sub][S:02][mal:anime:32182][opinion:liked]`
    * From HorribleSubs.
    * Liked the OP of the anime, the 3D animation part and all.
    * Didn't the like the second season as much since it stopped being a psyche anime and turned into a super hero one.

- Are You Lost? `[anime][AKA:"Sounan Desu ka?"][mal:anime:39456][opinion:ok][rec-by:repu]`

- Gintama Movie 2: Kanketsu-hen - Yorozuya yo Eien Nare `[anime][Arabic sub][mal:anime:15335]`
    * Confused, I didn't understand it because I haven't watch any of the previous Gintama entries.

- Golden Boy `[anime][English dub][mal:anime:268][opinion:liked]`
    * Watched because I've seen a clip of episode 1 where he talks about his computing experience.
    * Also, watched it because ProJared mentioned this anime in a positive light and said he was a true gentleman (YouTube video title: "Predicting The Game Awards")

- You're Being Summoned, Azazel `[anime][AKA:"Yondemasu yo, Azazel-san"][mal:anime:10216][opinion:liked]`
    * Downloaded S1+S2+OVA from user _WhyNot_ on Nyaa.si.
    * The first angel was disgustingly the best!

- Descendants of Darkness `[anime][AKA:"Yami no Matsuei"][mal:anime:553][opinion:liked]`
    * Descendents of Darkness feels like Loveless x Betrayal Knows My Name.
    * I've watched it with `kitsunekko.net`'s V3 subs, with subtitle track synchronization of -0.250s.
    * Available online: [Descendants of Darkness | Hentaisea](https://hentaisea.com/watch/descendants-of-darkness/)
    * [x] Download anime: [[2000] Descendants of Darkness_Êöó‰πãÊú´Ë£î(Èóá„ÅÆÊú´Ë£î)_TV.U2 | Nyaa](https://nyaa.si/view/1317630)

- Invincible `[cartoon][S:01][imdb:tt6741278][opinion:liked]`
    * 2021-05-07 Bari sent it to me.
    * S01E01: The first episode's ending left me gagging for more! üò≤
    * S01E05:  In _Scene 31_, the way the "war hammer-wielding"(?), white lion-like monster was killing others kind of mirror's the first episode's killings. It was goose-bump-y.
    * S01E08: _Scene 15_'s speech about children and humanity was kinda wholesome, albit selfish.

- Tokyo Godfathers `[anime][film][2003][opinion:liked]`
    * It has a gay drag for a main character. Miss Hana's 'Mother' is her drag mother?

- Chrono Trigger (SNES, USA) `[game][rpg][imdb:tt0210613][opinion:loved]`
    * Best game ever? ProJared keeps hyping it.

- ReLIFE `[manga][mal:manga:78523][opinion:liked]`
    * The overuse of chibi drawing style started to be unignorablely annoying (even since Vol1 or Vol2).

- Zetsuai 1989 `[anime][mal:anime:1041][opinion:liked]`
    * It is melodramatic, as Wikipedia describes it.
    * I think its name is cool: **Zetsu**ai = **Eternal** Love and hints at Desperate Love (**Zetsu**bou).
    * English subbed by Orphan Fansubs.
- Bronze: Zetsuai Since 1989 `[anime][mal:anime:1042][opinion:ok]`
- Bronze: Kouji Nanjo Cathexis `[anime][music][mal:anime:3007][opinion:meh]`

- Irr√©versible `[film][2002][French][English sub][imdb:tt0290673][opinion:liked]`
    * It's super disgusting and disturbing. It pains me to say this, but I love it.
    * Antonie of _It's Only the End of the World_ (2016 film) was the main character. Same "**brutal**" personality.

- Toilet-Bound Hanako-kun `[anime][Japanese][English sub][mal:anime:39534]`
    * Why? YouTube comments on Zetsubou Prison's trailer kept comparing it to Danganronpa and this anime; plus, Hanako-kun's voice actress (Megumi Ogata) is the same as Nagito's.
    * I loved the art style.
    * The opening is cool, esp the part where he was in chains and being touched by his shadow.
    * [ ] Learn: What's the name of this art style?
    * [ ] Idea: Use this art style for my blog's background to fill white space / between sections / at the end of the section/page.

- Electric Dreams `[film][1984][opinion:disliked]`
    * Sci-fi drama about a 'robosexual' computer that accidentally gains 'AI' and starts chasing after a romantic musician.
    * All characters talk very slowly and enunciate, as if they were teaching foreign language learners how to speak/mimic them.

- Jiang Ziya: Legend of Deification `[film][English dub][imdb:tt11177804][opinion:loved]`
    * Sequel to Ne Zha (2019).
