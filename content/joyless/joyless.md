# Joyless

My `joyless-XXXX.md` files actually serve as "game backlogs".

- Unless otherwise specified, it is a film and is in English.

**Abbreviations**:
- LP: Let's Play or Longplay

## Technicalities
- Idea: `JoylessLine` is a schema `Review` with `About` links.

- Wayback Machine - Internet Archive
    `<a href="{url}"></a> [archived:{timestamp}]` => `http://web.archive.org/web/{timestamp}/{url}`
    The URL defaults to the first preceding link (usually its the only one of that line)

- `S` (season number) and `E` (episode number)

- `opinion:{myOpinion}` = loved, liked, ok/fine, meh, disliked, or a 1-10 rating.
