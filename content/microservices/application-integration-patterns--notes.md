**Opinion**:
    OK.

**Notes**:
Talks about messaging patterns:
    * Sync with ack vs fire-and-forget
    * Point-to-point(queue) vs publish-subscribe (topic)
        queue => Amazon SNS
        topic => Amazon SQS
    * topic-queue chaining
    * Dead letter queue
    * FIFO queue with message groups
    * Message routing: Saga orchestration
        Saga => AWS Step Functions
