> - **Programmatic use cases enabled**: With a service API, the central team can finally enable programmatic use cases for metadata. For example, if your data portal application allows for tagging your datasets and fields with tags that specify the semantic-type of the field (e.g., email_address, customer_identifier) and stores that information in your metadata system, your data management infrastructure can start using this metadata to automatically delete data assets for customer ids that have requested the right to be forgotten, or to automatically create pseudonymised versions of these datasets for data scientists. In fact, at LinkedIn, we use Apache Gobblin to do exactly that, driven by metadata from DataHub.
