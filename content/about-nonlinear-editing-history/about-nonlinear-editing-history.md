Notes:

- [ ] Offline editing same as proxy editing?

- MPEG-2 standardized decoder

- **Avid** is not **AVS Video Editor**, is it? No.

- KAITO: What I did in "Hated by life itself" is make a EDL that FFmpeg used to mark the in and out points for clips and then assembled then in a linear fashion.

-  KAITO: Shotcut is a nonlinear video editing system... I still don't get it ;-;
