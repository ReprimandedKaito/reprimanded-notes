# Apache Camel

Camel is an open source integration framework to integrate various systems consuming or producing data.

Kaito's notes:
- Camel works with Kafka, Quarkus, and Spring Boot.
- Camel has components for Telegram, GitHub, Git, etc.
- I remember coming across it when learning about microservices and Enterprise Integration Patterns.

> ## Why Camel?
>
> Camel supports most of the Enterprise Integration Patterns from the excellent book by Gregor Hohpe and Bobby Woolf, and newer integration patterns from microservice architectures to help you solve your integration problem by applying best practices out of the box.
> 
> Apache Camel is standalone, and can be embedded as a library within Spring Boot, Quarkus, Application Servers, and in the clouds. Camel subprojects focus on making your work easy.
>
> Packed with several hundred components that are used to access databases, message queues, APIs or basically anything under the sun. Helping you integrate with everything.
>
> Camel supports around 50 data formats, allowing to translate messages in multiple formats, and with support from industry standard formats from finance, telco, health-care, and more.
