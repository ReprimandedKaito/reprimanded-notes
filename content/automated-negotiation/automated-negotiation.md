Notes by section:

> **Game Theoretic Models**
>
> As an example, consider the monotonic concession protocol with Zeuthen strategy [...]
>
> **Heuristic Approaches**
>
> The methods themselves may either be computational approximations of game theoretic techniques or they may be computational realisations of more informal negotiation models (e.g. [29], [30]).
> Examples of such models include: [3], [8], [18], [36], [41].
