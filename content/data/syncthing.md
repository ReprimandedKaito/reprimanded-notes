> Syncthing is a free, open-source peer-to-peer file synchronization application available for Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, Solaris, Darwin, and BSD. It can sync files between devices on a local network, or between remote devices over the Internet. Data security and data safety are built into the design of the software.

## How it works

- [x] read: https://docs.syncthing.net/users/syncing.html

> Device discovery is achieved via publicly-accessible discovery servers hosted by the project developers, local (LAN) discovery via broadcast messages, device history and static host name/addressing. The project also provides the Syncthing Discovery Server program for hosting one's own discovery servers, which can be used alongside, or as a replacement of the public servers.
